# Project 3: Spots - Jenn Nyberg 2025

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Video**  
 record video (10 min ) with screen share. Upload to the cloud (loom, google drive), make it public and add the link here
Content of the video

Open your web page in a browser and briefly describe the project
Explain how you made a layout for cards. Why did you use Grid or Flexbox?
Show how your project changes for the tablet and phone resolutions. Open any .css file and explain how you achieved these changes.
Open the index.html file in the VS code. Show which semantic tags you used in your HTML code. Why is it important to use semantic tags?
You used BEM methodology when developing the last three projects. Let's recall what these letters stand for. What is a block/element/modifier? How do you structure files and CSS code according to BEM?
Open the index.css file. Why do we connect fonts and normalize.css before all other styles?
How did you connect the fonts in your project? Which alternative fonts did you use?
Tell what the challenges were in doing the project and what you learned from it.

Good luck and have fun!
