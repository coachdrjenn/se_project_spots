# Project 3: Spots - Jenn Nyberg 2025

This is the first phase of a responsive website. It is created to adapt to multiple screen sizes and will eventually have multiple people contribute over time.

## Tech Stack

-HTML
-CSS
-responsive design
-Figma
-image compression

## Deployment

This webpage is deployed to GitHub Pages (however changing the pages and images files to be lower case in the project has broken the links so the website does not display correctly)
